TODO:

fix #links

check aria labels

NICE TO HAVE:
poster for video, load video behind it, remove image on click (animate button?)

aniamte sticky header?

animations for creation section (moving icons on hover maybe?)

replace tailwind?

make a sections component?

to write:
challenges: when to use grid vs flexbox
creating cool animations that are functional in different screen sizes and behaviors
reusable components (cards, section headers)

notes on design: used font w size 24 line 28 a bunch, but that doesn't exist in their style guide, so when referenced I used the guide that says 24px size and line-height 32px. Also, it would be ideal to have mobile font sizes for each font, for ease of naming variables
